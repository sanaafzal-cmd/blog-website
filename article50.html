                                Clean drinking water is a necessity most Americans never have
                                to worry about – unless they live in rural areas of
                                Appalachia. Many communities in southern West Virginia have
                                been on and off boil water advisories for years. There is
                                hardly a day that goes by when a notice does not run in The
                                Register-Herald. The Ravencliff McGraws-Saulsville Public
                                Service District (PSD) in Wyoming County was on a conserve and
                                boil water advisory from before Christmas until late January
                                2020, when an abandoned coal mine they were using as a water
                                source faltered. Officials say the boil water advisory was
                                issued due to a calibration adjustment needed at the water
                                treatment plant and one final water sample test requirement.
                                It was lifted Jan. 28. The conserve water advisory is,
                                however, still in effect for parts of Wyoming County. Wyoming
                                County Schools officials say they've been using disposable
                                items like Styrofoam trays in school cafeterias in the interim
                                to save water. They also say the water fountains were covered
                                with plastic and schools were relying on jugs of water in the
                                kitchen and to keep students hydrated during the boil water
                                notice. The ongoing water issue in Wyoming County is a prime
                                example of a rural area in Appalachia using every resource it
                                has to scrape by. The Ravencliff McGraws-Saulsville PSD
                                delivers water to close to 1,400 households on an 80-mile
                                stretch of main line. Customers include Southern West Virginia
                                Community and Technical College, Twin Falls Resort State Park,
                                Wyoming Continuous Nursing and Rehabilitation Center, Wyoming
                                County East High School, Glen Fork Elementary and Middle
                                School, along with an assisted living facility in Glen Rogers.

                                Communities impacted include Jesse, Matheny, Sabine, Glen
                                Rogers, Glen Fork, Ravencliff, Saulsville, McGraws, Key Rock
                                and New Richmond. The water from the local PSD has come out of
                                an abandoned coal mine for years with a demand of about 750
                                gallons of water per minute. The old mine was a viable option
                                until December 2019 when it started putting out 350 to 400
                                gallons of water a minute – about half of area demands. Water
                                officials say there’s no way of accurately knowing why the
                                water supply has decelerated because the mine is sealed.
                                They’re assuming structural changes inside the old mine are to
                                blame. “It could be a roof cave-in or floor crack; there’s no
                                way of knowing,” the public service district’s chairman Gene
                                Reid said. All Reid knows is that they need a solution – and
                                quick. The Ravencliff McGraws-Saulsville PSD has been forced
                                to ask the state and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) for
                                grant funding because they don't have the means to fix this
                                problem alone. While communities in larger areas have the
                                financial ability to implement water reservoirs and more
                                advanced water supply systems, financial constraints make that
                                difficult to do in rural areas of Appalachia. The solution is
                                the same one the area has known for years – tap into another
                                abandoned coal mine.

                                The new mine they want to use is located behind the former
                                John McGraw Grade School building. Wyoming County
                                administrator Mike Goode told commissioners earlier in January
                                the price tag to get a new abandoned mine up and running as a
                                water source will be about $1.2 million. The cost includes
                                placing a pump in the mine shaft, adding two miles of six-inch
                                water line from the mine to the water treatment plant,
                                providing a new power source at the mine site and acquiring a
                                new right-of-way. As of Jan. 29, the total project cost had
                                been changed to $1 million, said Eric Combs, project manager
                                for the Region 1 Planning and Development Council. The
                                Infrastructure Development Jobs Council (IDJC) will vote Feb.
                                5 on whether to give half of the grant money to fund the
                                project. They’re hoping to get a District 3 Crisis Grant for
                                $472,800 and a $27,200 Soft Cost grant, Combs said. If that
                                money comes through, they’re hoping the USDA will give them
                                the remaining $500,000 to make it happen. During a Jan. 22
                                commission meeting, Combs said state funding agencies are
                                doing all they can to speed up funding sources to pay for the
                                new permanent water source. The PSD says taking a loan isn’t a
                                viable option. “We have no way of paying loans with our
                                current situation,” he said. In the meantime, they are using a
                                small stream called Milam Creek as a temporary water source
                                while they wait to see if grant money rolls in.

                                “We have plenty of water at this source,” said Wyoming County
                                Commission president Jason Mullins. “but it is only
                                temporary.” “This is only a Band-Aid,” he said. Water
                                officials have rented a pump and hooked up a hose donated from
                                a local fire department to carry the creek water up a steep
                                hill to their water plant, where it is then treated with
                                chemicals like Del-Pac. When the water shortage originally
                                happened, field workers took shifts working around the clock
                                doing tasks like filling a gas tank on the temporary pump
                                every 20 minutes just to keep the water flowing. That
                                obviously wasn’t sustainable, so they’ve since managed to
                                acquire a diesel tank, so employees aren’t manually filling a
                                gas tank multiple times an hour. Plant operator Quentin
                                Shumate said he’s been working 20 hours a day during the water
                                crisis. This young worker didn’t complain about it though. “No
                                one ever lost water,” Shumate commented quietly. The financial
                                constraints of the water crisis have been difficult for the
                                PSD to bear. They paid workers $10,500 in overtime in December
                                and they are incurring about $500 a month just in fuel to run
                                the pump, Reid says. Goode says the county picked up the cost
                                for the fuel and has also paid for the PSD’s water turbidity
                                testing. Reid says one of the PSD’s customers, Twin Falls
                                State Park, is paying the $4,000-a-month bill to rent the pump
                                they are using to get the water out of Milam Creek – for now.
                                “We are committed to paying them back. They are doing it on
                                credit,” he said. “We have assured them when the money is
                                available, we will pay them back. We are hoping when we get
                                this final grant money that maybe we can use some of that to
                                pay some of it.” Reid says the PSD's electric bill has
                                skyrocketed since the plant is now operating 24 hours a day.
                                They are also incurring more chemical bills than normal to
                                treat the creek water and paying vendors extra to maintain the
                                equipment that is running overtime. “We’re now having to pay
                                for chemicals COD (cash on delivery) because we’re behind in
                                our chemical payments – but we can’t operate without the
                                chemicals,” he said. “We’re paying partial payments or some of
                                them are giving us credit. These are private companies and
                                they can’t keep doing it… Public vendors can’t keep giving us
                                money we can’t pay back in a timely manner,” he added.
                              </p>

                                Reid says the conserve water advisory, which is needed, is
                                consequentially hurting their bottom line. “Your rates are
                                down because we’ve been on a conserve water order for some
                                time, but that cuts our revenues down and our expenses are
                                going in the other direction. It’s a major deal,” he said.
                                Goode says Wyoming County is “picking up some of the bills for
                                them and some of it is reimbursable.” “The county commission
                                has stepped up to make sure everything keeps going on a steady
                                pace with no issues,” Goode said.

                                Meanwhile, some locals say they aren't drinking the water even
                                though it's being tested and treated. Water officials say many
                                water systems are supplied from rivers and creeks like Milam
                                Creek, and the water that residents are getting passes all
                                safe drinking standards. One local resident who asked to speak
                                under the condition of anonymity said, “People here don’t want
                                to drink it because it’s coming out of the stream. “I can’t
                                blame them,” she said. A local convenience store owner in
                                Saulsville confirmed that he is stocking and selling more
                                bottled water to area residents than normal. However, “Most
                                people around here are on a fixed income and can’t afford to
                                buy bottled water,” the woman who commented earlier said. Paul
                                Greene, 80, of Saulsville says he is not drinking the water
                                while it is being pumped from the creek. “I don’t want to
                                drink it,” he said. Greene says he’s heard rumors circulating
                                from other residents about the water not being safe to drink,
                                so he’s been driving 25 minutes to the nearest Walmart to buy
                                cases of water in bulk. Walmart offers grocery store pick-up
                                where workers load the water into Greene’s vehicle as he is
                                elderly and cannot carry the water himself. His wife is
                                disabled and cannot help, so Greene says he relies on his son
                                to come unload the water into their home so they can have
                                water they feel comfortable drinking. *** Water officials say
                                things will get dire in this area if the grant money isn't
                                approved. “If we don’t get the grant, in all probability,
                                things are going to be really, really bad,” Reid said. “The
                                current water source is not sufficient to supply it… The water
                                company is not going to be able to pump the amount of water we
                                need.” Although they are still pumping some water out of the
                                original abandoned mine, it is not enough. Reid says he’s
                                afraid the creek they’re using as their secondary source will
                                dry up in late spring or early summer and there is no backup
                                plan currently. There’s also a chance that their temporary
                                pumps could fail at any time – which would mean some residents
                                could go without water until a new plan is implemented. The
                                PSD is currently running its pumps around the clock, minus a
                                45-minute break during the day in which filters are cleaned.
                                “Our equipment doesn’t get to rest. Our pumps don’t get to
                                cool down,” said Reid. “We can’t do that 24/7 without doing
                                damage to the plant and pumps for an extended period of time.
                                At some point in time, one of the pumps is going to burn up.”
                                This is a “very, very temporary solution,” Reid says. ***
                                Essentially, Wyoming County is in a tough spot. But is another
                                abandoned mine the best decision? Amy Swann, executive
                                director of the Rural Water Association, said, “In the
                                southern coalfields when their water source is water from an
                                abandoned coal mine, you’re always subject to vagaries of
                                those particular strata of rock and substrata of rock. “Are
                                they going to stay still or are they going to move? Is
                                something going to collapse? You just don’t know,” Swann said.
                                But tapping into another mine “is the answer because it’s
                                about the only answer,” she said. Tapping into a water
                                reservoir would be difficult in this area because of
                                topography and “It’s really expensive to build those utility
                                systems in West Virginia,” she said. Also, when the water
                                system in Wyoming County was implemented years ago, coal
                                companies went with the cheapest, quickest option, Swann said.
                                Many of these coal companies are now out of business and the
                                mining companies didn’t leave towns with any maps of where the
                                water piping lies underneath the ground. “When the coal
                                companies left, they just left,” she said. “There’s no
                                mapping… When you put in a new system these lines run under
                                the house and we don’t have any maps, so we don’t know for
                                sure where the lines are. There’s a lot of challenges relevant
                                to a lack of central planning.” Swann says she wishes she had
                                the answer to solve the ongoing water issues in West Virginia.
                                “All of West Virginia’s got water problems,” she said. “There
                                are hard decisions that are being made every month on the
                                infrastructure council.” She says a declining population and
                                declining birth rates make it difficult for “decision-makers
                                to commit loan dollars and make borrowers leery of sending
                                loan dollars to places like that (Wyoming County) where you
                                may or may not get repayment.”
