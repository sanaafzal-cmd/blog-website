                                Coetta Atwell of Oceana is 68 years old and, after suffering
                                multiple aneurysms, cannot stand for long. She certainly can’t
                                get out and about. Violet Meadows of Wyoming County is 90. She
                                lives alone and has vertigo. Plus, she says with a laugh, “The
                                last time I tried to boil water, I burned the pot.” Georgia
                                Hatfield of Coal Mountain is 96 now. She keeps all her basic
                                necessities – bottled water, hand cream, tissues, medicines
                                and telephone – within arm’s reach of her living room couch
                                where she spends most days beneath a layer of blankets. She
                                has been receiving Meals on Wheels for about 10 years. Hazel
                                Conn knows them all. Knows their ailments, knows their
                                personalities, knows their needs. Conn has been a delivery
                                driver for the Wyoming County Meals on Wheels program for
                                almost 12 years – and to say she’s seen a little bit of
                                everything would be an understatement. She’s plunged toilets,
                                rescued pets, delivered meals from her own personal kitchen.
                                She gives hugs and personal attention to Wyoming County’s
                                elderly who live on limited resources. Once, Conn found an
                                elderly person who had passed away. No one else was there. No
                                one else had come calling. The Wyoming County Meals on Wheels
                                Program delivered more than 28,000 meals in 2019. Conn
                                delivered more than half of those. The fully equipped kitchen
                                at the Wyoming County Council on Aging on Mullins starts
                                buzzing around 6:30 a.m. weekdays. Two cooks arrive early to
                                prepare mealtime favorites like fried chicken and dumplings.
                                On holidays, diners might get an extra perk like a bag of
                                apples or turkey with all the fixings. No matter the weather,
                                drivers like Conn arrive around 9 a.m. to load the food trucks
                                and then are off on their routes. Conn travels about 100 miles
                                a day, five days a week. Inclement weather is just part of the
                                deal. "I’ve been out in eight inches of snow,” said Conn.
                                “There have been times I’ve been caught out and I still do my
                                run and I try to get to everybody.” The seniors on Conn’s
                                Wyoming County route perk up when the Meals on Wheels truck
                                arrives. “I know every one of them by name,” Conn said. “Most
                                of them will say bye and I love you. Most of them will hug
                                you. We’re like family.” Conn says many of her clients are
                                dependent on the Meals on Wheels program.

                              <p style="text-align: justify">
                                “For a lot of my people, I’m the only person they see for two
                                or three days at a time until I come back,” she said. “I hate
                                to leave them. A lot of them want to tell me about their
                                sickness and I want to be able to listen to them because they
                                don’t have anybody else.” Conn shared the story of one couple
                                in Oceana that would do without if the program went away. “The
                                wife has kidney failure and goes three days a week for
                                dialysis and the husband can’t do anything either,” Conn said.
                                She asked the elderly woman if she’s able to cook any meals
                                herself. “She said ‘No, we can’t cook anything. These meals
                                are our lifeline.’ I see quite a bit like that,” she said. To
                                qualify for the program, a person must be 60 years old or
                                older, be homebound, unable to leave his or her house under
                                normal circumstances because of illness, an incapacitating
                                disability, isolation or lack of transportation. Or all of the
                                above. Conn sees a lot of poverty. Most of her seniors live on
                                very small, fixed income budgets, she says. “A lot don’t have
                                a lot. They don’t have very much at all,” she said. “And
                                they’re really good people.” Conn routinely goes beyond what
                                her job description requires. For instance, one elderly lady
                                on her route loves fettuccini and coleslaw – but it’s not on
                                the delivery menu often. So, Conn purchased all the
                                ingredients out of her own pocket, got to work in her own
                                kitchen and whipped up that exact meal for the elderly woman.
                                “I’m not bragging on me, I’m saying God gave me a good heart
                                and I love people,” Conn said. “I love being around them and I
                                miss them when they’re not home or in the hospital.” Funding
                                dictates just how much The Meals on Wheels program in Wyoming
                                County can do – and just how many seniors can be served. “If
                                they could give us more funding, we could give more in the
                                meals – they could give them a better quality of meals,” Conn
                                said. “We could also reach out to a lot more people. We don’t
                                have the funding for it.” There are more than 1,000 seniors
                                statewide, and 35 in Wyoming County alone who sit on the
                                waitlist for the Meals on Wheels. The program is basically
                                first-come, first-served. “It’s not fair to our elderly people
                                and our veterans to sign up for this and have to be on a
                                waiting list and wait months,” Conn said. Jennifer Gibson,
                                Executive Director for the Council on Aging says, “We try not
                                to advertise our meals. When people call it’s depressing when
                                we have to tell them it’s going to be 6 months to a year
                                before we can provide you a meal.” Last year, the Meals on
                                Wheels Program distributed more than 1.3 million meals across
                                West Virginia. Gibson, who also serves as the legislative
                                chair for the West Virginia Directors of Seniors and Community
                                Services, says the state needs to allocate more money for
                                senior programs. She is currently asking the legislature to
                                invest an additional $5 million in the senior services budget
                                so the nutrition program can be expanded and to secure current
                                services. She says more money would also eliminate the home
                                delivery meals waiting list. In addition to home delivery
                                meals, the Council on Agency also offers education and
                                sit-down meals in a senior center giving the elderly the
                                chance to socialize. Government reimburses the program at a
                                rate of $6.36 for dining room meals and $6.80 for home
                                delivery meals, according to Gibson. The cost of a home
                                delivery meal is $8.84, says Gibson – or $2.48 cents less than
                                the actual cost. “We’re losing money providing this service.
                                Even though we’re a nonprofit, nobody can stay in business if
                                you’re losing money providing a service,” said Gibson. “We’re
                                trying to come up with the difference between that doing
                                fundraising and condensing deliveries to save on
                                transportation costs.”

                                Seniors who are well enough to leave their homes come to a
                                senior center for meals, which is less costly and has
                                additional social benefits. “A lot of them don’t have people
                                to depend on, and if they do, they don’t want to be burdens on
                                them either,” Gibson said. “I’ve been in people’s homes before
                                and you open the fridge and they have very few things.” Many
                                seniors don’t cook and tend to just “snack” throughout the
                                day, which isn’t healthy, Gibson says. “The only meal many get
                                is our hot meal one time a day,” she said. “Our services are
                                an investment not an expense to the state. They save money,
                                especially on healthcare costs,” she said. “If they (seniors)
                                can get good nutrition and use our transportation services to
                                go to their doctor visits, this helps them maintain their
                                quality life and get to doctor appointments. “We’ve had to
                                make tough choices over the years,” she said. “We’ve ended up
                                with waiting lists for seniors. We’re not willing to give up
                                the fight. We’re just going to keep doing what we have to do
                                to keep providing.”
