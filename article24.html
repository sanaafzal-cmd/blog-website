                                Armstrong is charged with killing Wilson, who was a rising cycling star, at a friend's house in Austin on May 11, 2022.
                            </p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify">
                                She was found murdered with multiple 9-millimeter gunshot wounds.

                            <p style="text-align: justify">
                                Police have said the murder happened after Armstrong learned about Wilson's affair with her ex-boyfriend, Colin Strickland, 35.
                            </p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify">
                                Wilson had a brief fling with Strickland while he was on a break from Armstrong, according to police.
                            </p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify">
                                Officials believe Armstrong tracked Wilson's location through her public account on the Strava fitness app, which is used by cyclists and runners to track and share their progress with others.
                            </p>

                                Armstrong's 2012 black Jeep Grand Cherokee was captured stalking the street on a Ring doorbell that night.
                            </p>
                         
                            <p style="text-align: justify">
                                Strickland walked his former lover back to the house at around 8.30pm the day she was killed, and Wilson's roommate found her lying on a bathroom floor covered in blood, per police.
                            </p>

                                Strickland has previously told The U.S. Sun that his relationship with Wilson was strictly platonic after he got back together with Armstrong and that he felt law enforcement skewed the version of events told in the affidavit.
                            </p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify">
                                "I had ended the relationship with Kaitlin and it was just interesting timing because Mo had come to Austin to visit a friend that exact week.

                                "That was clearly expressed to Kaitlin at that time and Kaitlin dated other men directly after that.

                            <p style="text-align: justify">
                                "Mo and I communicated about twice a month [after that] and I think it was skewed in a very misleading way in the affidavit," he said.
                            </p>

                                After the murder, Armstrong deleted all of her social media accounts and fled to Costa Rica.
