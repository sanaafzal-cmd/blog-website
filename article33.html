                                On Wednesday, police confirmed to The U.S. Sun they were looking into a separate possible sighting of Madalina in California.

                                The woman said the girl, who looked very similar to Madalina, approached her and asked for a ride "up north," but the woman didn't give her a ride as she didn't know who she was.

            On December 16, 2022, officials at the Sugar Mountain Police Department - which is in the same vicinity - provided photographs of a man and a young female that reportedly looked like the missing child.

            <p style="text-align: justify">
            “The man in the surveillance images was physically consistent in appearance to Octavian Cebanu, the only blood relative known to live in the United States," the court documents stated.

            This same information was revealed in multiple search warrants requesting financial records for Madalina’s stepfather, with police saying the Palmiter's financial accounts were “in use around the time of Cojocari’s last known sighting at school and in the time since.”

            In another search warrant, it was revealed that Madalina’s stepfather sent a message about the case to a family member, Mary Palmiter McCreary, on Facebook Messenger. 
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify">
            He reportedly wrote: “We are in some kind of investigation, Madi is missing and the local police have taken all our electronics, luckily I have an old phone, although they did not take my personal computer, prob cause (sic) they overloaded it, Diana is using it now to call her parents,” according to the search warrant.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify">
            Upon execution of this warrant, police seized multiple items, including several thumb drives and digital cameras, handwritten letters, a daily planner, a paper shredder with shredded paper, computer, cell phone, safe, guns and ammo, and a 2008 Toyota Prius vehicle, per the report.

                            <p style="text-align: justify">
                                The court records also indicate that officials are paying close attention to the couple's behavior while they remain in jail awaiting their hearing next month.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify">
            On one recorded phone call, Madalina’s mother told someone Palmiter may have given the girl away for money, per local affiliate WBTV.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify">
            A separate recorded call made by Palmiter noted that Diana had “a lot of cash" and that he had "financial stuff" coming up.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify">
            Palmiter’s brother reportedly told Palmiter “not to worry about” any financial issues during the call.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify">
            Diana had also reportedly asked a relative if they could help smuggle Madalina away from her home with Palmiter prior to Madalina's disappearance. 
                            </p>
                            <h2>STEPDAD'S LOGS</h2>
                            <p style="text-align: justify">
                                A search warrant executed on March 17, 2023 has revealed that Palmiter was housed in a jail cell with a confidential informant. 
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify">
            “The DEA CI gave the DEA-TFO information that Mr. Palmiter was often in his housing pod writing in his journal,” the police documents state.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify">
            The individual “reported that Chris told him he’s remembering the events regarding Madalina and was writing the recalled events down."
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify">
            Previous search warrants revealed that several notebooks and notepads were used by Palmiter for various reasons such as planning out daily activities.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify">
            “During the course of this investigation, [sic] has observed the defendant’s notetaking is a way for him to remember simple tasks, but also used to journal his thoughts and opinions," the documents stated.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify">
            It was then stated that police believed a search of Palmiter’s housing unit could reveal the notebook or journal, so they requested to do a search and seize the item if found. 
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify">
            Pursuant to the warrant, several items were seized, including an envelope that contained documents and notebooks, multiple commissary receipts with notes on them, a “loose note sheet with notes,” and another envelope with documents and notebooks labeled as “42 MAH.”
                            </p>
                            <h2>REPORTED MISSING</h2>
                            <p style="text-align: justify">
                                Madalina wasn't reported missing until officials at Bailey Middle School sent a letter to her parents demanding a meeting about the girl's absences.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify">
            After receiving correspondence from the school, Diana went in person several days later, on December 15, 2022, and told officials that Madalina had been missing since November 22, 2023.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify">
            When asked why she didn't report her young daughter missing to police, Diana reportedly said she worried it might start a conflict with her husband, Madalina's stepfather Christopher Palmiter, who they lived with.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify">
            On the day of Madalina's disappearance, the couple reportedly got into an argument and Palmiter took off to Michigan later that day.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify">
            He reportedly returned home three days later, and Cojocari told him that the young girl was missing, however, it wasn't until three weeks later that she was reported missing.
                            </p>

                            After she vanished, neighbors recalled seeing flames and smoke billowing from the couple's backyard.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify">
            The parents had set a large bonfire, which neighbors reported via calls to the police and fire department at the time, per The Daily Mail.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify">
            It has been confirmed that officials took samples of the outdoor fire pit area.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify">
            There was also an area of the couple's home that was blocked off with plywood, which the couple reportedly told police was being renovated to build an apartment inside the home.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify">
            Both Diana and Palmiter have been arrested and charged with failing to report Madalina missing. Their next hearing is scheduled for August 17.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify">
            After a previous court hearing, body language expert and author Greg Williams told The U.S. Sun that Diana appeared "disheveled," "downtrodden," and "rejected" in court.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify">
            Williams said the missing girl's mother "seemed to be out of it" as court officials talked to her.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify">
            Cops have publicly called out the couple and have said the two clearly know more than they are saying, although police have still been unable to solve the case.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify">
            The U.S. Sun has requested more information from the Cornelius Police Department.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify">
            Cornelius Police Department Public Information Officer Kristin Prescott said they are not conducting any interviews surrounding Madalina at this time.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify">
            “It is still very important to us that her name is shared so we can find her and bring her home," Prescott told The U.S. Sun.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify">
            Anyone with information is urged to call the Cornelius Police Department, your local FBI office, the nearest American Embassy or Consulate, or to submit a tip online at tips.fbi.gov.
