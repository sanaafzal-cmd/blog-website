                                There have been many unforgettable ladies to pass through the
                                shiny gates of Bravo's Real Housewives franchise over the
                                years. This reality TV formula has been a mega-hit ever since
                                The Real Housewives of Orange County premiered in 2006. As the
                                well-kept, affluent ladies of the OC sold viewers on the
                                series' concept, fans loved indulging in their million-dollar
                                mansions, designer duds, and luxurious lifestyles. Soon
                                enough, spin-offs were popping up in the likes of Beverly
                                Hills, Atlanta, New York City, and New Jersey. To keep things
                                fresh, Bravo has become known to do cast shake-ups from time
                                to time, with veteran housewives being replaced with fresh
                                blood. But the network — or executive producer Andy Cohen, for
                                that matter — isn't always behind these decisions. While we
                                may never know the real behind-the-scenes reasons that
                                resulted in some of these stars saying goodbye, many have
                                publicly spoken out about their exits. From family and
                                business endeavors to just too much drama with castmates,
                                several issues have factored into what led some of these
                                ladies to become housewives no more. Let's dig deeper into why
                                these Real Housewives quit.
                              </p>
              
                              <h3>Lisa Vanderpump found her way out of the doghouse</h3>
              
                              <p style="text-align: justify">
                                The infamous Lisa Vanderpump (also known as "LVP") was a
                                fixture on The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills since its
                                inception. The Vanderpump matriarch and successful
                                restaurateur decided to leave RHOBH behind after a
                                drama-filled Season 9, with her exit stemming from an argument
                                over a puppy named Lucy Lucy Apple Juice. In a nutshell,
                                co-star Dorit Kemsley adopted a pup from LVP's business,
                                Vanderpump Dogs, but gave the dog away after it allegedly bit
                                one of her kids. While Kemsley didn't realize the person she
                                gave Lucy to was going to take her to a shelter, Vanderpump
                                felt she should have been returned to Vanderpump Dogs. The
                                dramafied "puppygate" ordeal wound up in an article published
                                by Radar Online, leading several of Vanderpump's castmates to
                                accuse her of leaking the story. LVP went to the extent of
                                taking a polygraph test to prove her innocence, but the RHOBH
                                ladies weren't having it. In true housewives fashion, the
                                fight snowballed into enough drama to fill the season. Clearly
                                fed up with the situation, LVP skipped out on the show's
                                reunion and later announced she was quitting during an
                                interview with Daily Mail TV in June 2019. When a reporter
                                asked if she would return to RHOBH, Vanderpump replied, "I
                                think they've made it pretty impossible for me to go back
                                frankly. So ... no."
                              </p>

                                Heather Dubrow's plastic surgeon husband wound up being the
                                star
                              </h3>
                              <p style="text-align: justify">
                                The Real Housewives of Orange County star Heather Dubrow
                                quickly became a solid cast member when she joined the show in
                                Season 7. The buttoned-up wife of plastic surgeon Dr. Terry
                                Dubrow left the show after just five seasons in 2017, telling
                                The Daily Dish, "I have decided to go in another direction and
                                do what's best for my family and career." Apparently, Andy
                                Cohen told Heather "the door is always open" if she ever
                                decides to come back. While housewives fans may miss seeing
                                the Dubrows, it doesn't seem like Heather's had to miss her
                                old housewives friends too much. In 2018, she revealed on
                                Watch What Happens Live that she'd been texting with Tamra
                                Barney and Meghan King Edmonds, and also ran into Vicki
                                Gunvalson, all in the same week of her appearance. Sure,
                                Heather didn't mention any getaways or dinner parties, but it
                                sounds like these ladies have kept pretty close off camera.
                                Plus, it doesn't seem like Heather really needed the Real
                                Housewives series in her life anyway. Hubby Terry has picked
                                up a few extra side gigs since his family got into the Bravo
                                spotlight. In addition to launching Oxygen's License to Kill,
                                which investigates murderous medical cases, in 2019, he also
                                landed the reality show Botched. The long-running E! series
                                sees Terry and The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills alum
                                Adrienne Maloof's ex-husband, Dr. Paul Nassif, fix complicated

                              <p style="text-align: justify">
                                There's no question The Real Housewives of Atlanta star NeNe
                                Leakes left her mark on the Bravo show. The unapologetic,
                                original Georgia peach said goodbye after an eight-year run in
                                2015. "This is my opportunity to spread my wings and do
                                different things," Leakes told People. Referencing her
                                previous quarrels with her housewife co-stars, she added,
                                "There were times when I was a target. I won't miss the
                                negativity ... I feel a weight has been lifted off of my
                                shoulders." After Leakes quit, Andy Cohen tweeted that the
                                door would always be open: "We love @NeNeLeakes & she is
                                always welcome back to the house she helped build! She's a
                                Real Housewife forever!!" For her part, Leakes clearly didn't
                                forget that offer. In September 2019, Bravo shocked fans when
                                the RHOA alum was shown in the Season 12 promo trailer.
                                According to Entertainment Tonight, Leakes previously
                                announced her return in a since-deleted Instagram post, in
                                which she wrote, "Season 12 SIGNED! Nay Nay will see you in
                                NYC Sunday! Let's go #RHOA." While she was left out of the

                                Kim Zolciak-Biermann shocked fans of The Real Housewives of
                                Atlanta when she left the show in 2012. The lady who loves her
                                wigs had a much more shocking departure than former co-star
                                NeNe Leakes though. After being an Atlanta housewife staple
                                for five solid years, Zolciak-Biermann left straight in the
                                middle of filming Season 5. Do not pass go. Do not collect
                                $200. In all fairness, she was eight months pregnant at the
                                time — and clearly, mama don't play. "The fighting. The
                                stress. The gossip. The drama. I reached my boiling point,"
                                Zolciak-Biermann wrote on her Bravo blog. "Bravo and RHOA have
                                been beyond good to me, and I will be forever grateful for
                                some of the moments that occurred on the show, but I couldn't
                                deal anymore. I handled my s**t for five seasons, from fights,
                                to arguments to the tears, but being pregnant puts a whole new
                                spin on everything, and what happens on the outside affects
                                what happens with the baby on the inside, and that was my
                                priority!" Zolciak-Biermann had already been hired by Bravo to
                                star in the spin-off show, Don't Be Tardy, featuring her kids
                                and NFL star husband Kroy Biermann. Obviously, filming with
                                family was way less stressful than fighting with a bunch of
                                grown women every week: Zolciak-Biermann left the ladies of
                                Atlanta behind on a whim and never looked back!

                                The Real Housewives of New Jersey alum Caroline Manzo decided
                                to hang up her housewives fedora after five seasons. Manzo was
                                the resident matriarch of the Jersey clan and didn't appear
                                one bit intimidated by the strong personalities of co-stars
                                Teresa Giudice or Danielle Staub. Indeed, this reality star
                                stood strong in her convictions, so it was surprising that she
                                decided to leave in 2013. What was Manzo's reasoning? For one,
                                she was in the process of starring in another Bravo reality
                                spin-off, Manzo'd with Children, about her family. Manzo also
                                felt her "role [had] run its course" and she had "nothing more
                                to give," according to a Bravo blog post. "Over the past few
                                years my outlook on the show has changed from something I
                                couldn't wait to show my future grandchildren to something I
                                hope my future grandchildren never see," she went on to write.
                                "I've always prided myself on being a good example for my
                                children and my decision to leave is based on advice I've
                                always given them: 'Be true to yourself and be proud of who
                                you are, you are born with a name and you die with a name,
                                don't dirty it up." Manzo added that "peace and integrity
                                cannot be bought with money or fame." How do you argue with
                                that closing tagline?

                                her decision to leave after just one season, telling Us Weekly
                                in 2013 that it was "bittersweet." She explained, "I want to
                                build my brand outside of the Housewives — I've always been
                                really honest with the producers about that. I knew that while
                                I was filming it that I probably wasn't going to be doing it
                                again." That said, McLaughlin is one of many former housewives
                                who made sure the media knew she'd be "flattered" to be
                                invited back to the show. These housewives seem adamant about
                                making sure the public knows they quit — and weren't let go —
                                and also appear to take Bravo's offer to come back quite
                                seriously. With several having come and gone more than once,
                                McLaughlin also found herself on that repeat list. She later
                                re-joined RHOC, just in time for a magazine launch ... but her
                                second go around also lasted just one season. "[God's] plan is
                                always good and it was the perfect timing for me with the
                                launch of NOBLEMAN Magazine to return for season 12," she
                                wrote to fans on her OC Lydia blog. "I feel it is now, the
                                perfect twist to once again hang up my orange."

                                co-star), Caroline Manzo, had just announced that she was
                                leaving the series. Dina Manzo's second stint on RHONJ didn't
                                last much longer than her first. In 2016, she quit for a
                                second time. "I don't live in New Jersey anymore," she
                                explained to People. "I went through my divorce this year
                                [and] I moved out to California, so it didn't make sense."

                                I, was what the storyline called for. The constant beating of
                                the drum of 'She has cancer' or 'I'm being rude,' that was
                                what was required of us. That is not how we conduct
                                ourselves." We're guessing Amber Marchese won't be getting an

                                would be an understatement. The cute brunette — who's

                                — has parlayed her TV exposure into many side gigs. We're
                                talking a multi-million-dollar Skinnygirl empire, a spin-off
                                show (Bethenny Ever After) with her now ex-husband, Jason
                                Hoppy, and even her own daytime television show (Bethenny).
                                Frankel was one the original RHONY ladies, and after exiting

                                you for sticking with me through everything," she wrote in
                                part to her fans on Instagram around that time. "You started
                                this journey with me in my tiny apartment in my late 30's,
                                wondering what would happen to me. I was broke, single, had no
                                family and no idea what the future held." She later expanded
                                upon her reasons for leaving, stating to Variety that she was
                                ready for new things: "It's time to move on and focus on my
                                daughter, my philanthropy and my production partnership with
                                Mark Burnett, producing and starring in shows which represent
                                a shift in the conversation for women." It's highly doubtful
                                we've seen the last of this smart, business-savvy New Yorker.

                                was understandably keeping her family out of the spotlight.
                                "Now with everything going on in my personal life, I want to

                                After sharing her struggles with Lyme disease and announcing
                                that she and musician husband David Foster were splitting, The
                                Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Yolanda Hadid quit the
                                show in 2016 to focus on her health and personal life. The
                                Dutch-American mother to supermodels Gigi and Bella Hadid
                                confirmed her exit after Season 6, telling her Instagram
                                followers, "I believe that every exit is a new entry and with
                                that in mind I say goodbye to my @Bravotv Family as I continue
                                to focus on my recovery, my children and bring back the
                                privacy within our home." Fans watched Hadid struggle with her
                                illness on air, with Foster appearing to play the role of a
                                supportive husband, traveling to places like Switzerland for
                                every kind of experimental treatment under the sun in an
                                attempt to beat Hadid's debilitating disease. However,
                                according to her 2017 memoir, Believe Me: My Battle with the
                                Invisible Disability of Lyme Disease, the music producer
                                allegedly told his ex-wife, "Your sick card is up" (via E!
                                News). Understandably, that didn't go over well and the two
                                soon headed toward Splitsville. However, it's possible we
                                haven't seen the last of Mama Hadid. Bravo spoke highly of the
                                former model in a statement to People after she quit, saying,
                                "We wish her a full recovery and hope to see her again
                                sometime on the show." Will Hadid give RHOBH a second go
                                around? Stay tuned.
