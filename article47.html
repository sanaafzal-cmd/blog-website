                                Association annual journalism competition with the advertising
                                team winning five first-place awards and 19 overall. For the
                                fourth consecutive year, the Beckley newsroom took home second
                                place in General Excellence, with the Charleston Gazette-Mail
                                winning first. The Herald Dispatch of Huntington won third

                                marketing. We faced so many obstacles last year, so being

                                Stadelman, advertising sales manager for commercial printing.
                                Longtime local photographer Rick Barbero won Photo of the

                                consecutive year by virtue of accumulating more points than
                                any other newspaper in both advertising and news contest
                                categories. Competing in Division 2, the Bluefield newsroom
                                also won first place in General Excellence. The Beckley
                                newsroom eclipsed its performance of the previous year when it
                                won seven first-place awards and 21 overall. “Despite the
                                myriad challenges of a pandemic, despite fewer journalists on
                                staff, this team just simply went about its business,” said J.
                                Damon Cain, Register-Herald editor. “I couldn’t be more
                                honored to rub elbows with each and every one of these
                                professionals. “Our haul and Bluefield’s performance clearly
                                say there’s noteworthy journalism being committed here in the
                                southern reaches of the state and we do a pretty good job of
                                holding our own,” Cain said. First-place winners came from
                                across the newsroom with Barbero winning both feature and news
                                photo categories. Jenny Harnish swept the best video
                                competition, winning first-, second- and third-place awards.
                                Harnish also won first place in best photo essay for her
                                pictures from a drive-through farmers’ market in Greenbrier
